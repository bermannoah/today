### Prior to class:

* Set up [OregonSale](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/store_engine) prior to class. There won't be time for us to set up during class. Look at the `README` for details.
* Download the [Postman App](https://www.getpostman.com/)
* Make sure you have an active account with Sendgrid. You can set it up through [their website](https://sendgrid.com/marketing/sendgrid-services) but some students have run into issues with that. An easy workaround is to set it up through [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sendgrid).
