### Code Retreat (10:00 - 12:00)

Gather in the Big Workspace with Horace on his Last Day!

We'll partner up in cross-cohort pairs for a few sessions of implementing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

If you've never heard of the Game of Life, it's a "cellular automaton" that simulates hypothetical populations of cells by imposing a few simple rules.

The Game of Life is a popular programming exercise because it demonstrates some interesting emergent behaviors while still being straightforward to implement.

Here's a neat example of what a sophisticated representation can look like:
