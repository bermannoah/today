### The Plan

For those that are present at Turing, let's meet in Classroom C at 9:00 for a brief chat to put together a plan for the day. We want to get a sense of how many students are remote and how many are in the building.

One on ones have been moved to Tuesday next week, during the time previously reserved for check-ins. Check-ins will move to Monday afternoon.

If you had a one on one with Allison today, she will reach out and reschedule.

Tomorrow's instructional time (Intermediate SQL) will be assigned as homework due tomorrow morning.

### Introduction to SQL (9:30 - 10:30)

Same broadcast - new material. Let's start class with a basic rundown of SQL.

Then

We'll do an SQL challenge. It's based on the [fundamental SQL tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html#stq=&stp=0) so if you didn't get all the way through that, go ahead and finish it first.

[Here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/explore_sql.md) is the challenge.
