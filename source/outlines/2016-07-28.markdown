## 1606-B

Today is a heavy work day. When you're not in check-ins, you're working on your
project.

It's a good point to take a step back and ask:

* where did we think we'd be here on day 4?
* what have we learned since starting the project?
* are we staying true to the patterns and ideals we laid out?

Then set some goals for where you're going to be at the end of the day -- and do it.
