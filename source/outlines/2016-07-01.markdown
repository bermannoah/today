### Instructional Time (10:00 - 11:30)

#### 1602

Grab a seat in the **Big Workspace** or anywhere else you like to work

One of the best ways to learn about code is to see how other developers think about writing code.

You'll be working through a walkthrough Steve Kinney put together for his first pass at an Ideabox project. Don't try to print it out, it's about the quarter of the length of a book.

Classroom C

Re-DTR with your pivot team

With the remaining time, we'll be doing a personal project group brainstorm. Bring some ideas for the personal project, whether you'd like to do that idea or not.

#### 1605

Let's meet in your safety-zone aka Classroom A.

#### 1606-B

We'll be split into two groups this morning.

##### Echo

The Echo group will meet in Classroom B.

First, from 10:00-11:00, is a Robodoku Roundtable with Mike. Let's see what you've built!
Three students will have the opportunity to demonstrate their project and we'll
look to highlight differences in approach, explore what was hard/interesting, and
see if we're getting the same answers for different puzzles.

Then, from 11:00-11:30, we'll check out your next project: [CompleteMe](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown).
You'll work on it solo and have it ready for evaluation by instructors on Friday, 7/8.

##### Foxtrot

The Foxtrot group will meet at the Staff Table.

First, from 10:00-11:00, is a Credit Check Road Show with Beth and Jeff. You've
worked through the problem yourself, now let's work through it together. Pay
particular attention to the *process* Jeff and Beth use rather than the details
of the code.

Then, from 11:00-11:30, we'll intro your next project: [Flashcards](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown).
You'll work on it solo and have it ready for evaluation by instructors on Friday, 7/8.
