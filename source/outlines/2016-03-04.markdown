* ​*Intro to GoLang*​ in Classroom C with Allan Blair: When the tough gets going, Golang gets… uhh? Come learn golang with Allan. This session will get you up and running. Other sessions will include HTTP, concurrency and designing command line interfaces

* ​*DevOps*​ in Classroom B with Jason Pilz & Ryan Johnson: Our session is a follow-up to last session, so only people who came last time are set up to continue along….we will be creating a basic rails app and serving it on our droplets.

* ​*End-to-End Design Thinking* in the Big Workspace: How might we improve the way junior devs look for and secure job?*​ with Hack Design: Design Thinking is an iterative, user-centerd approach to finding creative solutions to problems.  This elective will confront problems related to the junior developer job search by going through the Design Thinking approach.  We will meet every other week and aim to take problem from research to product. This week we will discuss an overview of the methodology as well as begin to build “empathy” for users.

* ​*Hello Machine Learning*​ in Horace's Lair with Erinna Chen: Do you want to create the next dog of instagram and can’t figure out which hash tags to put on your posts? Computers can filter out that data and figure out what tags will get Amie to the next level. We’ll go through a tutorial which claims to be the “Hello World” to machine learning. Good for those who aren’t morning people and can’t make it to computability theory.

* ​*Git Workflow*​ in Classroom A with David Whitaker: Experiencing git-tastrophies?  Still unsure of how to optimize your git workflow?  Join me as I share some git tips and tricks that will make all of those headaches go away (hopefully) - great for module one folks.

* ​*Building a Menu Bar Application with Electron*​ at the big staff table with Steve: ​_[description pending]_​

* ​*The Turing Fight Song*​ the closet with Adam Hundley: Turing is a school and every school needs a fight song! We will collaboratively come up with a Turing Fight Song that will be proudly sung at all sporting events Turing is involved in. If you like being creative, rhyming and being extremely sarcastic then spend your hour with me.
