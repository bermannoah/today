Q&A about 18F, civic tech, that kind of thing

Greg helps manage the website and communications strategy for 18F. He has a background in teaching and software development. After several years of doing a mix of making or supporting makers, he learned that he thrives when doing the latter. He enjoys explaining how a complicated data problem was solved than writing the code to solve it. He is particularly interested in how technologies interact with large institutions like universities, governments, and industries.

What is 18F?
