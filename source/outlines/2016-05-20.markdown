This will be a Q and A on civic tech.

Greg helps manage the website and communications strategy for 18F. He has a
background in teaching and software development. After several years of doing
a mix of making or supporting makers, he learned that he thrives when doing
the latter. He enjoys explaining how a complicated data problem was solved than
writing the code to solve it. He is particularly interested in how technologies
interact with large institutions like universities, governments, and industries.

What is 18F:

18F is an office inside the General Services Administration that helps other
federal agencies build, buy, and share efficient and easy-to-use digital
services. They are an office of federal employees acting as a civic consultancy
for the government. Theyâ€™re transforming government from the inside out,
creating cultural change by working with teams inside agencies who want to
create great services for the public by building a suite of secure, scalable
tools and platforms that any agency can use to solve these a unique set of
technology problems that Federal agencies face.
