### Fundamental Rails Security (9:00 - 10:30)

A few tasks to run through ​*before*​ class:

1. Clone and run through the “Up and Running” heading for [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/store_engine). Make sure the app is running on your machine before class.
2. Make sure you have an active account with Sendgrid. You can set it up through [their website](https://sendgrid.com/marketing/sendgrid-services) but some students have run into issues with that. An easy workaround is to set it up through [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sendgrid).
3. Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
