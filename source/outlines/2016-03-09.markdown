### Work Time (9:00 - 10:30)

You have a lot of work time today so make the most of it.
It would be great to aim "pencils down" on new features by lunch time
so that you leave a solid afternoon and evening for any testing or
refactoring.

That said, a last minute frantic feature frenzy can also provide great learnings.

If you feel like you have a handle on your basic features, join Horace in Classroom A to talk about a few tricks for speeding up these beastly projects.
