### RushHour Evaluations and ActiveRecord Obstacle Course (9:00 - 12:00)

If you're not doing your RushHour evaluation please do the following:

* read [this article](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/routing) on routing in Rails in preparation for this afternoon's first Rails class. Google terms that are unfamiliar to you. Then answer the questions in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/c3575b4e49641c02fe18). Fork it, answer the questions, and add the link to your finished version in the comments of the original. Finish the questions before this afternoon's REST, Controllers, and Routing class.
