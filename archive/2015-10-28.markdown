### An Introduction to EventEmitter (10:45 - 12:00)

In a lot of the code we've written over the last view months, we've send messages to objects (or, called methods). Another approach, which will come up a lot throughout Module 4 is to flip this paradigm and letting our objects emit events declaring their state. In this session, we'll explore Node's `EventEmitter` library to look at how we can harness events in our code.
