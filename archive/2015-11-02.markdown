### Load Testing and Production Performance Analysis (9:00 - 12:00)

Join Steve in Classroom A to look at some techniques for [scaling up our Ruby on Rails applications](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/load_testing_and_production_performance_monitoring.markdown).

You'll be working in the following pairs:

* Adam Caron & David Shim
* Rick Bacci & Lovisa Svallingson
* Sebastian Abondano & Marla Brizel
* Samson Brock & Dmitry Vizersky
* Erik Butcher & Dave Maurer
* Max Millington & Jamie Kawahara
* Jai Misra & Alex Tideman

**Warm Up**: Before class begins, please create a Skylight account. Visit [https://www.skylight.io/](https://www.skylight.io/)
to sign up. We'll be using a free tier of the service, so you won't have to enter any payment information.

### Building a JavaScript Application from Scratch (1:00 - 2:00)

Meet back up with Steve in Classroom A to talk about the inner workings of building a JavaScript application.

### The Scale Up (2:00 - 3:00)

* [The Scale Up](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)
* [Keevah](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/keevah)

**Homework**: This morning, we spoke about setting up Skylight to track performance. Skylight is just one option. Another popular option is New Relic. Ideally, you would probably only use one of these in a project. That said, we'd like you to get comfotable with both.

1. Work through [this tutorial](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/performance_analysis_with_newrelic.markdown) on setting up New Relic on Blogger.
1. Set up New Relic on your Scale Up projects.

### Building and Securing an API (9:00 - 12:00)

In this lesson you will learn how to create an internal API that serves JSON and XML.

Before this session, please clone the class repo using the following command:

```
git clone -b building_api https://github.com/turingschool-examples/storedom.git building_api
```

* [Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/building_an_api.md)

Join Jorge in Classroom C.

### ActiveRecord American Gladiators (1:00 - 2:00)

Clone [Storedom](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/storedom) and checkout the branch titled `active_record_american_gladiator`.

Do the normal Rails-y setup stuff. Run your tests using the `rspec` command. You should see one failing test with the remainder skipped. You will only need to edit code in this spec file: `./spec/active_record_american_gladiator_spec.rb`.

For the tests that are failing, get them to pass. For the tests that are passing, you need to refactor them to use ActiveRecord instead of Ruby. Update the code inside of the `#Changable Start` and `#Changeable End` tags. Leave the rest of the code the same.

It's highly recommended that you become familiar with the [ActiveRecord Querying page](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) on the Rails Guides, particularly for RailsEngine.
