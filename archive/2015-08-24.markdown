and expectations of Module 4](https://gist.github.com/worace/89fb2afc748efd87d49d).

### Building Turing (9:00 - 12:00)

Meet in the workspace to put some sweat equity into Turing. That includes you, Dmitry.

You'll be joining a team with people from 1503 and 1508.

### The Pivot Kickoff (1:00 - 2:00)

Your Dinner Dash application was almost great, but it turns out that we need to pivot the business model.

In this project, you'll build upon an existing implementation of Dinner Dash. You will transform your restaurant ordering site into a platform that handles multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business will have their own name, unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

You can find the complete project description [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.markdown#technical-expectations).

The teams are the following:

* Marla Brizel, Lovisa Svallingson, Dmitry Vizersky - Work on Marla's codebase
* Rick Bacci, Erik Butcher, Drew Conly - Work on Drew's codebase
* Jack Yeh, Adam Caron, Dave Maurer - Work on Adam's codebase
* Sebastian Abondano, Max Millington, Alex Tideman - Work on Sebastian's codebase
* Michael Dorrance, Rob Cornell, Mitch Ashby - Work on Michael's codebase

### 1508 Homework

* Foxtrot: Complete [these String/Integer exercises for tomorrow](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/working_with_strings_and_integers.markdown)
* Echo:
  * [Shell](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/master/shell.md)
    - Read the entire thing, after you complete each section, repeat the information you covered in the previous sections up to that point
    - Memorize the keybindings for the shell
    - Memorize the keybindings for the Mac
    - You will know you have memorized them sufficiently when you can perform them from memory
    - It would be good for you to go through the katas, as well, but not necessary
  - Read about hard / soft skills in The Little Book of Talent
    - Chapter 7: Before you start, figure out if it's a hard skill or a soft skill
    - Chapter 8: To build hard skills, work like a careful carpenter
    - Write a paragraph about each, describing what it would look like to apply these skills to your time here at Turing
  - Complete [this SuperFizz exercise for tomorrow](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/super_fizz.markdown)
