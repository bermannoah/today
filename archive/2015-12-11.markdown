#### Self-Study

##### Learn JavaScript Data

This week you've done a lot of work with object-oriented JavaScript in the context of your Game Time applications. This morning, we want you to get a sense of some of functional side of JavaScript. There are some core concepts in this tutorial that we think will be really useful when you return back to your web applications.

### 1508

#### Large Group: Mastermind in 90 Minutes

Join Andrew in the **Big Workspace**

You all are tired and have been working on similar Rails projects for over a month now. Let's switch things up. No databases, no frameworks, no project manager.

Work either on your own or in self-selected pairs to see how far you can get building [Mastermind](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown). Don't worry about writing a perfect implementation. Hack out your code and have fun. Some of you may choose to write tests, others may choose to test manually. Totally up to you.

If you finish, some of you will, try to refactor. Can you write it using recursion instead of `until` or `while` loops? Can you remove all `if` and `case` statements? An easy approach is to build a hash with valid inputs that point to corresponding classes. Another more advanced approach would be to use the [command pattern](https://dockyard.com/blog/2013/11/05/design-patterns-command-pattern). Notice that all classes define the same `execute` method. Hold off on attempting to use the command pattern until you have a working implementation of Mastermind first.

#### Small Group Session

Meet with Josh at one of the big tables in Classroom A to discuss how to build successful projects.
