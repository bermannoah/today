### Debugging Sinatra Errors and/or Database Relationships (9:00 - 10:30)

Join Mike in the big workspace. This morning, you'll complete one of the following options:

#### Choice 1: Debugging Sinatra Errors

You'll need the `debugging-practice` branch of [this repo](https://github.com/rwarbelow/1511_task_manager/tree/debugging-practice). How do you do that? Navigate into your `1511_task_manager` repo from yesterday afternoon's Sequel lesson, then fetch all remote branches (`git fetch`) then checkout the debugging branch (`git checkout debugging-practice`). Run `rake test`, then start fixing those errors.

#### Choice 2: Implementing Database Relationships

Follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/73301b9f2bfb07ec5b6c) to experiment with adding categories to your Task Manager.
#### Done?

If you finish, this would be a good opportunity to write a blog post on anything that you learned in week 1. Over the course of this module, you will publish *at least one* blog post for your Module 2 portfolio.
