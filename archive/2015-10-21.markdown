### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Thanks to Ryan Asensio and Lovisa for the Pull Requests to The Warm Up!

In mathematics, a Ruthâ€“Aaron pair consists of two consecutive integers (e.g. 714 and 715) for which the sums of the distinct prime factors of each integer are equal. For example, we know that (714, 715) is a valid Ruth-Aaron pair because its distinct prime factors are:

714 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 17

715 = 5 * 11 * 13

and the sum of those is both 29:

2 + 3 + 7 + 17 = 5 + 11 + 13 = 29

The name was given by Carl Pomerance, a mathematician at the University of Georgia, for Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron, as Ruth's career regular-season home run total was 714, a record which Aaron eclipsed on April 8, 1974, when he hit his 715th career home run. A student of one of Pomerance's colleagues noticed that the sums of the distinct prime factors of 714 and 715 were equal.

For a little more on it, see MathWorld - http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ruth-AaronPair.html

Your task today is to determine if a pair of numbers is indeed a valid Ruth-Aaron pair.
