### All: Testing Strategies (9:00 - 10:30)

Classroom A. There is no truth, the truth you make up will manifest for you when you go to use it,
you need to make a [leap of faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFntFdEGgws)!
Lets see how that looks, and how that fits into our testing to give us guidance as we code.
We'll approximately follow [this material]9https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/starting_at_the_top_with_an_acceptance_test_to_drive_work_and_tests.markdown)

### All: Character Count (10:30 - 12:00)

Stay with Josh in classroom A.

First, take five minutes to [read the Character Count challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/character_count.markdown)

Second, get together with a person near you spend 15 minutes brainstorming:

* What things/ideas/tools have you used before will be useful for this problem?
* What would a trivial input be like? Minimum work? Minimum work +1?
* How would you structure a test that, if it passes, you know you're done?
* What kind of edge cases might you run into?
* Is there anything ambiguous about the challenge itself?
* Can you write out a logical flow for the algorithm in English?

Third, work by yourself for forty minutes to implement it stopping at 10:30.

Fourth, spend 10 minutes comparing solutions with your previous pair. Did you
run into the same snags? Make the same progress?

Last, let's spend about 15 minutes looking at a few individual solutions.

### All: Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

Do the things. Mike is available for your questions. Any questions.

Well, maybe not any questions, but a good amount of questions.
