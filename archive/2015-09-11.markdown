### Project Evaluations (9:00 - 12:00)

Please make sure you stop working on your project by 9AM.

Today when you're not doing evaluations we want to do some different things
with programming, a bit out of the norm. We're not going to be peering over
your shoulders, but please try to keep yourself focused and productive. Play
can still be learning.

* Want to practice your fundamental logic, conditions, and branching? Return to
[RubyWarrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior).
* Want to try writing an AI for a battle tank? Yes, seriously. Try out
[RTanque](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque).
* Try creating some graphics with the powerful but not super easy [Gosu Library](https://www.libgosu.org/). Look for their intro tutorials.
* Play with a new language you haven't tried before like [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) or [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php).
