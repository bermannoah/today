#### Prework Review and Questions (9:00 - 9:30)

Steve will review and answer questions about the assigned pre-work in Classroom C.

1. [Building Desktop Applications with Node and Electron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbSvc8_BHaw)
1. [Getting Started with Electron](https://vimeo.com/155240396)
1. [Building Real-Time Applications with Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfGORL8ebn8)

#### Getting Off the Ground with Bartleby (9:30 - 10:30)

Let's get the bare minimum up and running with our project.

- [Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/getting-bartleby-started.md)
- [Example Completed Version](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/bartleby-electron-example)

#### Asynchronous JavaScript: Callbacks and Promises (10:30 - 11:15)

One of the problems with this application is that we have to deal with two different approaches to asynchronous JavaScript: Node's callback pattern and Ember's promises. In this lesson, we'll spend a little bit of time discussing each before we move along to talk about building an abstraction of Node's callbacks in order to eliminate the need to deal with two different styles.

#### Contributing to File Bin (11:15 - 12:00)

With our the foundation of our project in place and an understanding of how to work with promises and callbacks. We'll take a look at the file system APIs in Node in order to figure out what tools we have at our disposal to implement additional features.

- [Node's File System APIs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
- [File Bin](https://github.com/stevekinney/file-bin)
- [mock-fs](https://github.com/tschaub/mock-fs)

### What is Polymorphism? (9:30 - 10:00)

Let's talk about Polymorphism.

* Watch [this RailsCast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOFAcbxdWjY) up to 3:30.
* Read [this blog post](https://richonrails.com/articles/polymorphic-associations-in-rails) and stop when you see the `rails g controller` stuff.
* Work in pairs to create the migrations and models that would represent this sitaution: The principal of a school needs to keep track of her meetings with students, parents, and employees. Create four models (`Student`, `Parent`, `Employee`, and `Meeting`) so that the first three models can have many meetings, and a meeting can belong to either a student, parent, or employee. Try out your associations in the console (`rails c`). Refer back to the RailsCast if you've forgotten how to do that.

#### Pairs
