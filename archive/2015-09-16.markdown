### Project Work Time (9:00 - 4:00)

Install the spec helper in case you haven't done so. You can get it [here](https://github.com/turingschool/rales_engine_spec_harness).

By today, you should have finished your **Record Endpoints** and the **Relationship Endpoints**. During this worktime, you should focus on completing the **Business Intelligence Endpoints**, refactor and improve your coverage.

If you find an issue with the spec helper, please let us know so that we can fix it as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience and let's finish strong.

Mike will be available for questions in the morning. Andrew will be available for questions in the afternoon.
