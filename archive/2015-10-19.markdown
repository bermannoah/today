It's time for games. Game proposals are set in stone at 4pm today. This is your time to try out some different ideas and sketch out your plans. Final game selections are due to Steve at the end of the day.

All those things that say "with instructor approval" in the [project specification][gametime]? Today's the day to get instructor approval.

Join Jeff in the front of Classroom A.

We'll start from the basics together. But if you'd like to read more before or after the session check out the following:

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBrz9HmjFOs)

### Echo: Sorting Suite Reviews & Recap (9:00 - 10:30)

Join Horace at the Mega Table to review your Sorting Suites.

### Foxtrot: How Testing Works (10:30 - 12:00)

Horace will join you in Classroom A to recap what you learned over the weekend and discuss [How Testing Works](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/how_testing_works.markdown).

### Echo: File I/O (10:30 - 12:00)

Jeff will join you at the Mega Table to talk about [File I/O](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/file_io_and_csvs.markdown).

### All: Spiraling Design & Test (1:00 - 3:00)

Join Horace in Classroom A.

We've talked about this idea of "spiraling" the design of a solution. You start
with the most trivial of test cases and work outwards. Sounds easy, right? It's
hard to do. Let's practice with a real problem.

1. Get together with the pair listed below
2. Read [the Credit Check challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/credit_check.markdown)
3. Use the strategies we discussed earlier this week to setup a plan of attack
especially focusing on test cases of slowly increasing difficulty
4. Then it's time to write code. Work next to each other and be each other's first-choice
helper when questions/problems pop up. But each of you should do your own programming
on your own computer.

Here are your random pairings:

* Hector Huertas Baeza & Lauren Thomson
* Penney Garrett & Brant Wellman
* Jordan Lawler & Taylor Moore
* Beth Sebian & Brennan Holtzclaw
* Lenny Myerson & Aaron Greenspan
* David Codina & James Crockett
* Greg Armstrong & Brenna Martenson
* Emily Blanchard & Beth Secor
* Dan Winter & Steven Olson
* Steve Pentler & Admir Draganovic
* Toni Rib & Joseph Perry
* Alexis Uriel Navarrete on fill-in/solo duty
