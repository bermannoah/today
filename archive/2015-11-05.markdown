You'll be doing this while you are not being evaluated in Classroom A.

### Project Evaluations (9:30 - 12:00)

#### With Horace

* 9:30 - Leonard Myerson & Alexis Navarrete
* 9:55 - Brant Wellman & Beth Secor

### Peer Refactoring (1:00 - 2:30)

Join Horace in Classroom A to swap projects around and do
some Peer Refactoring.

Pairings:

* Alexis Navarrete, Daniel Winter
* Steven Olson, Penney Garrett
* Emily Blanchard, Beth Sebian
* Aaron Greenspan, Steven Pentler
* Hector Huertas, Gregory Armstrong
* Jordan Lawler, Brenna Martenson
* James Crockett, Toni Rib
* Admir Draganovic, Taylor Moore
* Leonard Myerson, Brennan Holtzclaw
* Beth Secor, Joseph Perry, Brant Wellman

Person on the left is __A__, right is __B__

__Iteration 1 (1:00 - 1:45)__

__A__ Should spend 10 minutes reviewing and looking
at __B__'s code.

Then __A__ and __B__ should pair on a refactoring of
__B__'s code.

Attempt one of the following improvements:

* Find an important class that is untested
or under-tested, come up with some good test cases for it and
implement them. Focus especially on tests that can be phrased in terms of clear
inputs and outputs -- I input an array of 3 strings and get back a hash with
these keys, etc.
* Find a method longer than 6 lines and focus on extracting
smaller methods from it
* Find a piece of functionality that doesn't belong in the
class where it is located. Move it to another class (or create a new
class for it). (__Hint:__ For each method in the class try saying it
aloud: "Class Name, can you please do X" -- do these assignments make sense?)

__Iteration 2 (1:45 - 2:30)__

Swap roles and perform the same exercises on the
other person's code.

### Exercise: OkCuGit (2:30 - 4:00)

Stay in Classroom A to work on the [OkCuGit](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/ok_cugit.markdown)
