### Scale-Up Evaluations

When you're not being evaluated, read the first chapter of
[Node.js The Right Way](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6pa1dgactbcq4ku/NodeJSTheRightWayChap1.pdf?dl=1).

Use Redis to build a notifications service in Rails by working the [Building a Notification Service][bns] tutorial. We'll be exploring Redis in a little more depth tomorrow.

* Tyler Komoroske & Pat Wey
* Edgar Duran & Matt Stjernholm
* Shannon Paige & Charissa Lawrence
* Matt Rooney & Aaron Careaga

### Little Shop Kickoff (9:30 - 12:00)

Join Rachel in Classroom B to kick off [Little Shop of Orders](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown).

Create a [team expectations](https://gist.github.com/rwarbelow/0fed3529495a814eabb1) document by forking the original.

* John Slota & Amber Crawford & Shannon Paige
* Edgar Duran & Matt Rooney & Matt Stjernholm
* Jhun de Andres & Ryan Johnson & Charissa Lawrence
* Emily Dowdle & Jason Pilz & Sekhar Paladugu
* Jill Donohue & Pat Wey & Marlo Major
* Aaron Careaga & Torie Warren & Nicole Hall
* Robbie Lane & Tyler Komoroske & Ross Edfort

You'll have ~30 minutes to brainstorm your Little Shop idea with your group. When you're ready to pitch your idea, sign up on the whiteboard for a slot with Rachel.

Next steps:

* generate a new Rails project for your little shop (don't forget to use Postgres for your database)
* create a waffle.io and add Rachel (rwarbelow) and Andrew (Carmer) as collaborators
* push to Heroku (get in the habit of pushing to Heroku frequently)
* create wireframes for most important views: Think about what you think the workflow should be on the site. Which of those views is most important? In addition to the home page wireframe, create wireframes for the next two most important pages. Examples might be: A users' profile page, a product page, an admin dashboard etc.

### Cart and Order Lifecycle (1:00 - 2:30)

### DTR (11:30 - 12:00)

The *most important* thing you can do first is to set expections. Consider questions like this:

* What did you struggle with in your last project *academically*?
* What went right / what went wrong with your most recent pair?
* What helps you do your best work?
* What cuts down your productivity?
* What times of day are you smartest?
* What outside constraints do you have (kids, SO, pets, etc)?
* What would make this project a success for you?
* What would make it a failure?

### Decomposing Headcount (1:00 - 2:30)

Classroom A.
