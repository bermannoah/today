### Project Work Time (1:00 - 2:00)

#### Echoes

If you don't have Sinatra serving your NightWriter,
on your server, then check in with me to figure out
what hurdle is tripping you up.

Otherwise, work with the trotters

* Ask them how you can help them with Headcount.
* Opt for removing hurdles over offering design advice,
  there are many ways to do this project,
  it's okay if their approach differs from what you did or what I advocated.
* Make sure their code is passing my high-level test.
* Hugs are an acceptable way to offer aid.
* Note that I (Josh) have changed the
  [evaluation matrix](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown#evaluation-rubric)
  So far, no one has submitted a pull request, and I'm a bit worried about that.
  Maybe walk them through the process.

#### Trotters

Clone my big test suite: [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount_test_harness](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount_test_harness)
It doesn't contain everything we need, but you need to pass this if you want a 4,
and it will keep you from getting too far off track.

I'll come around and check in on you after working with the echoes.
If you are stuck on something be sure to ask a classmate
to look at it with you.

If you get all my tests passing,
and you're hitting your head against the cursor of consensus,
then band together with the other groups that are in the same situation,
and help me figure out what the requirements should be.
Send me pull requests on the project description and on the test harness,
I haven't gotten that far in my implementation,
and I don't have the bandwidth to get back to it.

You need to work together on this, or you won't have the consensus,
and then you won't know what the requirement should be.
Help me improve the project!

### Echoes / Trotters

Yes, I gave y'all adorable nicknames. You're welcome.
