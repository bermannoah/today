### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Hello everyone!

We are going to be trying something new with warmups. If you go to [this site](https://thewarmup.herokuapp.com/),
a fresh artisanal warmup will be generated for you daily.

The formatting is pretty raw, and Redcarpet hates me, so it is not as pretty as it could be.

Please let Mike know if you encounter any issues, and as always, [pull requests accepted](https://github.com/mikedao/the-warm-up).

### Mathias from Schoolrunner (4:10 - 5:00)

Our friend Mathias from [Schoolrunner](https://home.schoolrunner.org/) will be in
Classroom A after wrapup to tell you a bit about the company. If you're interested in Denver and educational technology, you should be there!

### JSON Fundamentals (11:00 - 12:00)

In the following weeks, you will be reading and providing data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a human and machine readable format used widely for APIs.

In this lesson, you'll learn about this particular data format, its structure, and how to interact with it programmatically.

The materials for this class are:

* [Slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y9lesby67su8e3w/Turing%20-%20JSON%20Fundamentals.key?dl=0)
* [Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/json_fundementals.markdown)
* [Video](https://vimeo.com/138705059)

Meet Jorge in Classroom B.

### Apicurious Kickoff (1:00 - 2:30)

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning this concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

As we build these features, we'll also be working with the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

You can check the full project description [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#technical-expectations).

Meet Jorge in Classroom B.

### Apicurious Work Time (2:30 - 4:00)

Please work on your individual projects. Remember that by the end of today, you should have:

1. Your application deployed and working on Heroku.
2. Omniauth installed and working.
3. Your application layout implemented.

Even though this project is individual, you can ask each other questions and collaborate on features. This, however, does not mean that you can copy other people's code.

### Homework:

* Find Penney, say "this one's for you", and give her a hug. If it turns out you needed a hug, too, you can instead say "thanks, I needed that".
* Go through [Blowing Bubbles](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/master/katas/blowing_bubbles_part1.rb) part 1,
  here is [the video](https://vimeo.com/137837006), if you want to go through it with me.
  If you want to get extra value from it, go through it a second time without the video
  (if you need to, maybe take notes when you watch it so that you can do this).

### All: Pairing Exercises (9:00 - 12:00)

While you are not being evaluated, you will be working on pairing exercises.

#### Pairings

Sorry that not all pairs have overlapping review times. I did the best I could! :)

* Shannon & Penney
* Ryan & Edgar
* Chad & Jhun
* John Senft & Emily
* Aaron & Marlo
* Jason & Sekhar
* Patrick & Nicole
* Robert & Amber
* Torie & Jill
* Matt S & John Slota
* Matthew Rooney & Tyler
* Ross & Charissa

#### Activity

You've likely setup Exercism. You've intended to work on Exercism.
You've procrastinated on Exercism. You've been scared to submit a solution.

Let's get over that hump. On one of your computers you should pair together and complete at least one entire Exercism exercise, including submitting your solution. Ideally Exercisms would take about an hour, so if you're really clicking you could get two submitted this morning.

You're not abandoning your partner to work on your project that was due at 9AM, right? RIGHT? :)
