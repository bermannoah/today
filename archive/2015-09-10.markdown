### All: Inter-Project Pairing (1:00 - 3:00)

This afternoon we're going to twist our pairing plan a little bit. We know
you're hammering away on your projects due tomorrow, but we still want to build
up some of your pairing skills.

This afternoon please:

* Find your pair below
* Pair on the left person's project for the hour 1-2
* Pair on the right person's project for the hour 2-3
* Use a pomodoro timer so each session is two pomodoros
* Each hour make use of a different protocol briefly described below

#### Protocols

Think of these as a game you're playing that has the side effect of creating some
code. The game is more important than the code.

* Driver/Navigator: navigator is the primary "thinker" and the driver is the
primary typist. Don't let the driver think very much, or else the navigator is
just watching programming. *Alternate every five minutes* or faster. Use a timer.
* Devil Tester: pair member A starts by writing the first test. Pair member B then
has to write the implementation that passes the test. B then writes the next test
and A is responsible for passing it, then writing the next test. If a test can't
go from red to green in five minutes, it's too big and gets deleted to try again.
Use a timer.
* Popcorn: Both your hands stay on the keyboard at all times. In Popcorn, you
collaborate to write both tests and implementation, but *you write no more than
one line of code* before switching control. A writes a line, B writes a line, A
writes a line, etc.

These are meant to be frustrating and feel awkward. Think of it like dance class.
You can't just show up with someone new and have perfect chemistry. You need to
get over the awkwardness, get your feet warmed up, and start to anticipate each
other's thinking and movements.

#### Pairings

* Penney Garrett & Edgar Duran
* Marlo Major & John Slota
* Jhun de Andres & Amber Crawford
* Aaron Careaga & Nicole Hall
* Emily Dowdle & Sekhar Paladugu

Then the rest of the day you're on your own!
